# Installation

Install python 3.7: https://wsvincent.com/install-python3-mac/

Normally I would recommend using pyenv and virtualenv: https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv

But since it's probably too complicated, just do:
`pip install --user requirements.txt`

# Running

From the root:
`./export_data.py {FOLDER_PATH} {JSON_FILEPATH}`

(`./export_data.py --help` if you forget which arg goes first)
